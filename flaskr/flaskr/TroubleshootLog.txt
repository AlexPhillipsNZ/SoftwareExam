The current directory is invalid.

Changed this line, hoping for a fix.
DATABASE=os.path.join(app.root_path, 'H:\2017S1\SoftwareExam\SoftwareExam\flaskr\flaskr\tmpflaskr.db'),

Error: No such command "initdb".

Followed through steps 1-4 Checking they were done correctly. Tried multiple arrangements on function placement with no working result.
